##Introduction
Stop Video Download For YouTube is a chrome extension that adds a **stop video** button next to the **subscribe** button in YouTube. Clicking on the **stop video** button stops the video from getting downloaded onto your computer. It does not work for HTML5 videos, however.

##Installation
You can get it from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stop-video-download-for-y/njgmjigkhbgepkepgiieeoeigkdifndi/). Users using Mozilla, Opera or other browsers can make use of [this Userscript](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5326-stop-youtube-video-download).
